# Physics Simulation

This is a simple physics simulation program that demonstrates bouncing balls within a tkinter-based graphical user interface.

## Description

The simulation generates multiple balls that bounce around the canvas area. The balls interact with each other upon collision, changing their directions based on the collision angles and applying a bounciness factor. 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required Python dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the simulation using Python:
    ```bash
    python physics_simulation.py
    ```

## Usage

- Upon running the program, the graphical simulation window will open.
- The balls will start bouncing around the canvas.
- The GUI displays the count of balls present in the simulation.
- Each ball collision will trigger the creation of a new ball after a cooldown period.

## Credits

This simulation was created using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI.
